# LinuxGSM Docker

A docker container distribution of https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM

Dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/r/akshmakov/linuxgsm/

Run Game Servers in Docker, multiplex multiple LinuxGSM deployments easily by taking advantage of Dockers port mapping.

## Image Tags

- `latest` `base` - base image with linuxgsm.sh script and user setup
  base image can be used to install any server
- *`servername`* - convenience images with preinstalled game servers

## Usage Docker

The base image is just a dockerized environment to run `linuxgsm.sh`. As such it can be used as though its on a local install that is, to list the available servers

`docker run --rm akshmakov/linuxgsm:base linuxgsm list`

in general any command can be executed.

If no command is passed, the container will not exit allowing `docker exec` to be used to execute commands


### Base Image

Lets  build up a local server using just the base image

We will mount the host directory `/srv/lgsm/server1` to the container folder `/home/lgsm` , this will persist all GSM data on the host.

User ID mapping with containers is not-trivial, so this tutorial will use `chmod` workaround for quick host mounted volumes, but this is not ideal. 

```
# create the host folder
$ mkdir -p /srv/lgsm/server1 && chmod 777 /srv/lgsm/server1
```

```
# start the server environment into a shell
$ docker run --rm -it -v "/srv/lgsm/server1:/home/lgsm" akshmakov/linuxgsm:base bash
```

```
# install quake 3 arena server
$ linuxgsm q3server
$ q3server install
# exit the shell
$ exit 
```

The server is now built up, you can edit the config files from the host or within a shell
in the container.

All that is left is to start the server, in this case, q3server uses port 27960 so we will publish it.


```
# start the server with port publishing and docker logging
$ docker run --name quake3  -t -d -p "27960:27960" -v "/srv/lgsm/server1:/home/lgsm" akshmakov/linuxgsm:base q3server start
```
**Note:** the `-t` is  **required** due to the way linuxgsm works

```
# check the logs
$ docker logs quake3
```

```
# open a shell on the container to inspect or modify
$ docker exec -it quake3 bash
```

You can repeat the process to install another gameserver on the same host, make sure to change the published port if you are installing multiple copies of the same gameserver.


### Specific Image

These images are predownloaded versions of the LinuxGSM server library in docker containers.

These images are taged on dockerhub as `akshmakov/linuxgsm:SERVERNAME`

The images can be run without a command, which by default will start a server

These images are best to be extended, as the server data will be overwritten by any mounted volume


``` Dockerfile
FROM akshmakov/linuxgsm:$SERVERNAME

COPY myserverconfig.cfg /home/lgsm/lgsm/config-lgsm/$SERVERNAME/$SERVERNAME.cfg
```

then any extended image may be run as such

```
# build the custom image
$ docker build -tag local/linuxgsm:$SERVERNAME .
sudo docker run --name arkserver --rm -it -d -v "/home/lgsm/:/home/lgsm" lgsm-docker bash# start the server
$ docker run -d --name my-custom-server local/linuxgsm:$SERVERNAME 
```

**NOTE:** -t tag not necessary for the specific images

## Usage Docker-Compose

Docker-compose can be used to manage multiple installations.


``` docker-compose.yml

version: '2'

services:

  # Pre-setup "base image" (see above)
  # Or an installation copied from an existing server
  q3server-1:
    image: akshmakov/linuxgsm:base
    volumes:
      - '/srv/lgsm/q3server-1:/home/lgsm'
    ports:
      - '27960:27960
    tty: true

  ## specific image - no customization
  ## Running on alt port
  q3server-2:
    image: akshmakov/linuxgsm:q3server
    ports:
      - '27961:27960'
    tty: true 

  ## custom specific image
  ## assume Dockerfile for this server exists
  ## in local dir
  q2server:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.q2server
    image: local/linuxgsm:q2server
    ports:
      - '27910:27910'
    tty: true
```

You can start the whole cluster

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Examine specific logs

```
$ docker-compose logs q2server
```

Take one down and leave the others running

```
$ docker-compose stop q2server
```


## Container Overview

`linuxgsm.sh` script is particularly picky about paths and does things a little different from a typical daemon.

In particular this docker images seeks to encapsulate LinuxGSM exactly as it is, to allow for easy transition from non-docker based deployments

These quirks are

- Script downloads a whole bunch of other script components (hard to track docker cache)
- Script installs game servers in script install dir (hard to relocate)
- Script refuses to run as root (Requires image have users added and permissions granted)
- Script runs server in a tmux session (Difficult to attach to output)


This Container runs `linuxgsm.sh`  under a generic user `lgsm` and script and server data installed under the home directory `/home/lgsm`

## Easy step

the script create a user name lgsm app path is /home/lgsm/

- Download the git repo git clone ...
- Change permission to executable : chmod +x lgsm-build.sh && chmod +x lgsm.sh
- Execute linuxgsm-docker-build.sh
- Edit some variable at the top of the linuxgsm-docker.sh script
- Execute lgsm.sh all you need is in this script

## TODO

- Install script to edit variable in script automaticaly
- Multi-lgsm server type on one lgsm install
- Support all server type depency and default port in a function bash
